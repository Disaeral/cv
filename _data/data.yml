      details: |
        In my role, I supported and developed frontend applications, including the company's main product. I also played a key role in enhancing SEO and optimizing the performance of the company's webpages. This involved a complete redesign of the feedback function, resulting in improved layout and semantics, with a particular focus on leveraging my expertise in static website generators. Additionally, I conducted functional testing and wrote unit tests, significantly increasing the test coverage within our projects. I also delved into end-to-end (e2e) testing, with plans to implement integration tests in the future. My responsibilities extended to researching low-level API browsers and implementing solutions based on them, alongside code refactoring and code splitting to enhance project maintainability and scalability. I also customized the backend to extend the functionality of frontend applications and collaborated with DevOps on configuring CI/CD projects. Throughout, I leveraged React features, such as functional components and custom hooks, to enhance project maintainability and extensibility.
